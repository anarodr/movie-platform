#### b) Application Functionality

### Home Page

When the user lands on the **Home Page**, they can select and click to search for movies. This action redirects them to the **Movies List Page**, where all available movies are displayed.

### Movies List Page

- Initially, all movies are retrieved and displayed.
- The user can use search fields to filter results:
  - **Name & Director**: Perform partial (non-exact) searches.
  - **Year Range (From - To)**: Allows filtering movies within a specific year range.
  - **Rating Range (From - To)**: Filters movies based on a rating range.
- There is a button to **Create a New Movie**, which redirects the user to the **Movie Creation Form**.

### Movie Creation Form

- The form includes frontend validation: the **Submit button is only enabled if the form is correctly filled out**.
- After successfully saving a new movie, a **confirmation toast** appears.
- If there is a mismatch between frontend and backend validation or another saving error occurs (e.g., trying to submit a decimal value), an **error toast** is displayed.
- The user can return to the **Movies List Page**, and previously applied filters remain saved in Redux.

### Movie Editing Form

- From the **Movies List Page**, the user can also **edit an existing movie**.
- The **same form component is reused** for both creation and editing. When editing, the form is pre-filled with the movieâ€™s existing data, retrieved using a **getOne** request.
- The user can return to the **Movies List Page**, and filters remain intact.

### Movie Deletion

- The user can permanently delete a movie from the **Movies List Page**.
- Before deletion, a **confirmation modal** appears to prevent accidental removal.

### Responsive Design

- All screens are **fully responsive**, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices.
- The application works smoothly on **desktop, tablet, and mobile resolutions**.

This structured approach ensures a smooth user experience while maintaining validation consistency between the frontend and backend.

#### c) Testing

The frontend uses **React Testing Library** along with **Vitest** to ensure the correctness of components and user interactions.

### ðŸ”¹ Integration and UI Testing

- Simulates **user interactions** (e.g., clicking buttons, filling out forms) to validate expected behavior.
- Ensures that key workflows, such as **movie creation, editing, and filtering**, function correctly.
- Uses **Vitest** as the test runner, which is optimized for Vite and provides fast execution times.

This approach guarantees a **stable, maintainable, and user-friendly** frontend, preventing regressions and ensuring a smooth user experience.

### 2. Backend

#### a) Architecture

The backend follows a **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)** approach, ensuring a clean separation of concerns between the **application, domain, and infrastructure layers**.

```
â”œâ”€â”€â”€application         # Application layer (Use Cases)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€â”€delete_uc       # Use Case: Delete a Movie
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€â”€find_all_uc     # Use Case: Find All Movies
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€â”€find_by_id_uc   # Use Case: Find a Movie by ID
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€â”€provision_oc    # Use Case: Provision
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€â”€save_uc         # Use Case: Save a New Movie
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€â”€update_uc       # Use Case: Update an Existing Movie
â”œâ”€â”€â”€domain              # Domain layer (Business logic)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€â”€value_objects   # Value objects (immutable domain concepts like Rating, Year) here used also to apply validations
â””â”€â”€â”€infrastructure      # Infrastructure layer (controllers, database)
```

### Benefits of Hexagonal Architecture:

- **Scalability**: Easily extend or replace components (e.g., databases, APIs) without affecting core business logic.
- **Maintainability**: Code remains modular and easier to test by isolating business rules from infrastructure details.
- **Flexibility**: Supports multiple input/output adapters, making it easier to integrate with different technologies.
- **Testability**: Encourages unit testing of business logic without relying on external dependencies.

This approach makes the system more **adaptable, testable, and future-proof**, aligning with best practices for modern backend development.

#### b) Testing

The project uses **pytest** for testing at both the **application level (unit tests)** and the **infrastructure level (integration tests)**.

### Command

This from parent folder will execute the tests for both backend and frontend inside the docker container.

```bash
make test
```

### ðŸ”¹ Unit Testing (Application Layer)

- Unit tests focus on **business logic** without dependencies on external systems.
- Use cases (e.g., finding, saving, updating, and deleting movies) are tested in isolation.
- Mocking is used to decouple tests from the database and external services.

### ðŸ”¹ Integration Testing (Infrastructure Layer)

- **Database (MongoDB)**: Tests validate repository implementations and database interactions to ensure data consistency.
- **Controllers (FastAPI Endpoints)**: API integration tests verify request/response behavior, status codes, and input validation.
- Uses **TestClient from FastAPI** to simulate API requests and **a MongoDB instance** to avoid modifying real data.

This testing strategy ensures **high code reliability**, **prevents regressions**, and keeps the system **robust and scalable**.
